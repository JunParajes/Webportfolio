        <p class="paragraph">
          I adhere to standard naming conventions such as BEM (Block,
          Element, Modifier) to maintain clean, scalable, and
          understandable code. I am continuously learning and staying
          updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.
          Currently, I am eager to expand my skills by learning React and
          CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind to enhance my ability
          to create dynamic and responsive web applications.
